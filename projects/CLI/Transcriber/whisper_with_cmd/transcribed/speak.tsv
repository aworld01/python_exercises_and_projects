0	6860	Hello everyone. Hope you are well. Welcome to Ola Boon. In this series, we will be working
6860	12540	on improving our English language skills. So, let us begin.
12540	17380	Before getting on with the course, you must be aware of the importance of English language
17380	24580	for you. In case you are an aspirant appearing for bank exams or other public sector exams,
24580	30500	English is tested in a separate section in these exams. So English is vital for you.
30500	36340	Apart from this, English comes in handy in case of social or professional interactions
36340	42420	like prospective job interviews. So, in this series, you will be given tips along with
42420	49580	small exercises to enhance your English language skills. The very formula that we will be following
49580	57580	throughout this series is reading, writing, speaking and learning. Now, read as extensively
57580	65420	as possible. Why is reading important? You may ask. Well, reading improves your vocab,
65420	72300	comprehension, ability and analytical skills. But most importantly, reading broadens your
73260	79900	horizons and improves your writing skills. This brings us to writing. You may write a diary
79900	87180	or a daily journal which will help you draw down the points that might have transpired throughout
87180	94220	the day. You may ask, why is this exercise important? Well, the situation now must be
94220	99100	something like this that you might conceive an idea in your native language and then
99180	106220	you go on to translate the same into English. In this course, we are not aiming for translations.
106220	113020	No. What we are aiming at is that you need to conceive the original thought in English itself.
113740	120140	And how would that be possible? Well, it would be possible only if you speak as frequently as
120140	125980	possible in English. Don't worry about the mistakes that you might commit initially.
125980	129980	Those mistakes will be taken care of throughout the course of this series.
130620	137260	And lastly, learn. What will you learn from this series? Well, if you read and write regularly,
137260	143020	you are bound to learn vocab, that is new words. You are bound to learn sentence, structure and
143020	150380	formation. And most importantly, you will learn grammar. So, this is the general formula that we
150380	156300	will be following throughout our course. Moving that to the first exercise of this session.
157020	164140	Here, you are given a passage which has a few errors. Go ahead and try to spot as many errors
164140	170300	as you can. Let us do it together. Professional writers will tell you that reading make them
170300	178140	better writers. Here, reading is a singular subject which is being qualified by a plural
178140	184380	verb that is make. So, this causes subject verb disagreement.
185740	193580	Make must be replaced by makes in order to rectify this error. Moving on. Lucky for us,
193580	200300	reading in your spare time has gotten even easier. This is correct. Not only is there plenty of
200300	207020	grade books. Now, here you will notice is a singular verb which qualifies grade books,
207020	211980	that is a plural subject. Here also, there is subject verb disagreement.
212540	218940	Is must be replaced by are a plural verb in order to qualify this plural subject.
219820	226060	Moving on, not only are there plenty of grade books to choose from to put in your back pocket,
226140	232220	but now you can access thousands of reading resources off your smartphone. You will notice
232220	238540	here that the preposition of renders the sentence meaningless. Off must be replaced by
239100	245580	from in order to make the sentence correct and meaningful. It means you can access reading
245580	252620	material reading books from your smartphone using your smartphone. Moving on, on the bus,
252620	258540	add the coffee shop waiting in line or right before you go to sleep. It does not matter when
258540	263740	or where you choose to add this reading time to your routine. Here you will notice that the
263740	270700	spelling of routine is incorrect. He must be replaced by I. Reading further, the fact is you
270700	276700	always got at least 5 to 10 minutes in your day when you can squeeze in a little extra reading
276700	283340	practice. This is correct, but the last sentence also has an error. It's that simpler. Well,
283340	288940	the comparative degree of adjective is used only when a comparison is being carried out.
288940	296380	Here, this is not the case. So, don't know must be replaced by simple. It is not important if you
296380	304460	were able to spot say 3 errors or 4 errors. What is important here is that it is easy to spot errors
304460	309020	in someone else's work that work could be written material or it could be speech.
309740	315500	This brings us to the second exercise of this session, which is recording yourself.
315500	322780	I want you to record yourself and carry out this exercise in 3 steps. First, introduce yourself
322780	329740	in not more than 3 to 4 sentences. Then move on to introducing yourself and talk about your hobbies
329740	336300	or interest. And lastly, introduce yourself, talk about your hobbies and talk about the
336300	342860	immediate goal in your life and how you are working towards it. Now, repeat exercise 1,
342860	350780	that is, spot errors in your recording. It is as simple as riding a bike or driving a car.
350780	357340	Until and unless you do it, you can't get better at it. It is as simple as that. So,
357420	364140	practice as much as possible and record yourself for at least 30 days, that is at least a month.
364860	371820	So that you can make new mistakes and learn from those mistakes. So, in these sessions,
371820	377660	we will discuss basic grammar rules, have vocab quizzes and discuss tips that will help you
377660	383900	gain confidence and command over the language. This brings us to the tips or takeaways from this
383900	390060	session. Well, where to start and how to accomplish your goal of getting better at English?
391020	397340	The first is, imitate someone. It could be someone you admire, someone you look up to,
397340	402780	it could be an actor, it could be a politician, it could be anybody. But make sure that this
402780	408940	someone is a native English speaker. Why native? Because they have a good control and command
408940	415020	over the language. What I want you to imitate is not the accent, but the pronunciation,
415020	419020	the facial expressions and the facial movements of this person.
419980	427020	Secondly, speak slowly. Don't rush through your words or sentences. This would indicate that you
427020	433740	are nervous and want the conversation to end as soon as possible. Instead, compile your thoughts
433740	441420	and try to speak as clearly and confidently as possible. Next, use easy words in the beginning.
441420	447820	What I expect you to do is, use as easy sentences and words in the beginning. You are not expected
447820	454140	to use difficult words right in the beginning. As you read and write and practice, you are bound
454140	459660	to learn new words and that will help you improve your vocabulary and confidence over the language.
460460	467580	The last thing is, read everything. You can pick up a newspaper every day and spend at least 30
467580	474140	minutes reading editorials of these newspapers. In this process, be conscious of the new vocab.
474140	479420	Make a list of the new words that you learn every day. This will help your comprehension
479420	486460	ability and your analytical skills apart from the speaking ability. Read everything that you
486460	493500	can possibly lay your hands on and read in front of a mirror out loud. This will help you gain
493500	500380	confidence and improve your comprehension ability and analytical skills. The last point
500380	507420	follows from this. Are you aware of the new words that you come across and try to note down those
507420	515340	words and use them in your daily life? This brings us to the end of this session. In the next session,
515420	522940	we are going to do some pronunciation exercises and discuss some basic grammar rules along with
522940	529180	a few tips that I'll share which will help you enhance your language ability. Thank you.
