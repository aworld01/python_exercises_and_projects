00:00.000 --> 00:06.860
Hello everyone. Hope you are well. Welcome to Ola Boon. In this series, we will be working

00:06.860 --> 00:12.540
on improving our English language skills. So, let us begin.

00:12.540 --> 00:17.380
Before getting on with the course, you must be aware of the importance of English language

00:17.380 --> 00:24.580
for you. In case you are an aspirant appearing for bank exams or other public sector exams,

00:24.580 --> 00:30.500
English is tested in a separate section in these exams. So English is vital for you.

00:30.500 --> 00:36.340
Apart from this, English comes in handy in case of social or professional interactions

00:36.340 --> 00:42.420
like prospective job interviews. So, in this series, you will be given tips along with

00:42.420 --> 00:49.580
small exercises to enhance your English language skills. The very formula that we will be following

00:49.580 --> 00:57.580
throughout this series is reading, writing, speaking and learning. Now, read as extensively

00:57.580 --> 01:05.420
as possible. Why is reading important? You may ask. Well, reading improves your vocab,

01:05.420 --> 01:12.300
comprehension, ability and analytical skills. But most importantly, reading broadens your

01:13.260 --> 01:19.900
horizons and improves your writing skills. This brings us to writing. You may write a diary

01:19.900 --> 01:27.180
or a daily journal which will help you draw down the points that might have transpired throughout

01:27.180 --> 01:34.220
the day. You may ask, why is this exercise important? Well, the situation now must be

01:34.220 --> 01:39.100
something like this that you might conceive an idea in your native language and then

01:39.180 --> 01:46.220
you go on to translate the same into English. In this course, we are not aiming for translations.

01:46.220 --> 01:53.020
No. What we are aiming at is that you need to conceive the original thought in English itself.

01:53.740 --> 02:00.140
And how would that be possible? Well, it would be possible only if you speak as frequently as

02:00.140 --> 02:05.980
possible in English. Don't worry about the mistakes that you might commit initially.

02:05.980 --> 02:09.980
Those mistakes will be taken care of throughout the course of this series.

02:10.620 --> 02:17.260
And lastly, learn. What will you learn from this series? Well, if you read and write regularly,

02:17.260 --> 02:23.020
you are bound to learn vocab, that is new words. You are bound to learn sentence, structure and

02:23.020 --> 02:30.380
formation. And most importantly, you will learn grammar. So, this is the general formula that we

02:30.380 --> 02:36.300
will be following throughout our course. Moving that to the first exercise of this session.

02:37.020 --> 02:44.140
Here, you are given a passage which has a few errors. Go ahead and try to spot as many errors

02:44.140 --> 02:50.300
as you can. Let us do it together. Professional writers will tell you that reading make them

02:50.300 --> 02:58.140
better writers. Here, reading is a singular subject which is being qualified by a plural

02:58.140 --> 03:04.380
verb that is make. So, this causes subject verb disagreement.

03:05.740 --> 03:13.580
Make must be replaced by makes in order to rectify this error. Moving on. Lucky for us,

03:13.580 --> 03:20.300
reading in your spare time has gotten even easier. This is correct. Not only is there plenty of

03:20.300 --> 03:27.020
grade books. Now, here you will notice is a singular verb which qualifies grade books,

03:27.020 --> 03:31.980
that is a plural subject. Here also, there is subject verb disagreement.

03:32.540 --> 03:38.940
Is must be replaced by are a plural verb in order to qualify this plural subject.

03:39.820 --> 03:46.060
Moving on, not only are there plenty of grade books to choose from to put in your back pocket,

03:46.140 --> 03:52.220
but now you can access thousands of reading resources off your smartphone. You will notice

03:52.220 --> 03:58.540
here that the preposition of renders the sentence meaningless. Off must be replaced by

03:59.100 --> 04:05.580
from in order to make the sentence correct and meaningful. It means you can access reading

04:05.580 --> 04:12.620
material reading books from your smartphone using your smartphone. Moving on, on the bus,

04:12.620 --> 04:18.540
add the coffee shop waiting in line or right before you go to sleep. It does not matter when

04:18.540 --> 04:23.740
or where you choose to add this reading time to your routine. Here you will notice that the

04:23.740 --> 04:30.700
spelling of routine is incorrect. He must be replaced by I. Reading further, the fact is you

04:30.700 --> 04:36.700
always got at least 5 to 10 minutes in your day when you can squeeze in a little extra reading

04:36.700 --> 04:43.340
practice. This is correct, but the last sentence also has an error. It's that simpler. Well,

04:43.340 --> 04:48.940
the comparative degree of adjective is used only when a comparison is being carried out.

04:48.940 --> 04:56.380
Here, this is not the case. So, don't know must be replaced by simple. It is not important if you

04:56.380 --> 05:04.460
were able to spot say 3 errors or 4 errors. What is important here is that it is easy to spot errors

05:04.460 --> 05:09.020
in someone else's work that work could be written material or it could be speech.

05:09.740 --> 05:15.500
This brings us to the second exercise of this session, which is recording yourself.

05:15.500 --> 05:22.780
I want you to record yourself and carry out this exercise in 3 steps. First, introduce yourself

05:22.780 --> 05:29.740
in not more than 3 to 4 sentences. Then move on to introducing yourself and talk about your hobbies

05:29.740 --> 05:36.300
or interest. And lastly, introduce yourself, talk about your hobbies and talk about the

05:36.300 --> 05:42.860
immediate goal in your life and how you are working towards it. Now, repeat exercise 1,

05:42.860 --> 05:50.780
that is, spot errors in your recording. It is as simple as riding a bike or driving a car.

05:50.780 --> 05:57.340
Until and unless you do it, you can't get better at it. It is as simple as that. So,

05:57.420 --> 06:04.140
practice as much as possible and record yourself for at least 30 days, that is at least a month.

06:04.860 --> 06:11.820
So that you can make new mistakes and learn from those mistakes. So, in these sessions,

06:11.820 --> 06:17.660
we will discuss basic grammar rules, have vocab quizzes and discuss tips that will help you

06:17.660 --> 06:23.900
gain confidence and command over the language. This brings us to the tips or takeaways from this

06:23.900 --> 06:30.060
session. Well, where to start and how to accomplish your goal of getting better at English?

06:31.020 --> 06:37.340
The first is, imitate someone. It could be someone you admire, someone you look up to,

06:37.340 --> 06:42.780
it could be an actor, it could be a politician, it could be anybody. But make sure that this

06:42.780 --> 06:48.940
someone is a native English speaker. Why native? Because they have a good control and command

06:48.940 --> 06:55.020
over the language. What I want you to imitate is not the accent, but the pronunciation,

06:55.020 --> 06:59.020
the facial expressions and the facial movements of this person.

06:59.980 --> 07:07.020
Secondly, speak slowly. Don't rush through your words or sentences. This would indicate that you

07:07.020 --> 07:13.740
are nervous and want the conversation to end as soon as possible. Instead, compile your thoughts

07:13.740 --> 07:21.420
and try to speak as clearly and confidently as possible. Next, use easy words in the beginning.

07:21.420 --> 07:27.820
What I expect you to do is, use as easy sentences and words in the beginning. You are not expected

07:27.820 --> 07:34.140
to use difficult words right in the beginning. As you read and write and practice, you are bound

07:34.140 --> 07:39.660
to learn new words and that will help you improve your vocabulary and confidence over the language.

07:40.460 --> 07:47.580
The last thing is, read everything. You can pick up a newspaper every day and spend at least 30

07:47.580 --> 07:54.140
minutes reading editorials of these newspapers. In this process, be conscious of the new vocab.

07:54.140 --> 07:59.420
Make a list of the new words that you learn every day. This will help your comprehension

07:59.420 --> 08:06.460
ability and your analytical skills apart from the speaking ability. Read everything that you

08:06.460 --> 08:13.500
can possibly lay your hands on and read in front of a mirror out loud. This will help you gain

08:13.500 --> 08:20.380
confidence and improve your comprehension ability and analytical skills. The last point

08:20.380 --> 08:27.420
follows from this. Are you aware of the new words that you come across and try to note down those

08:27.420 --> 08:35.340
words and use them in your daily life? This brings us to the end of this session. In the next session,

08:35.420 --> 08:42.940
we are going to do some pronunciation exercises and discuss some basic grammar rules along with

08:42.940 --> 08:49.180
a few tips that I'll share which will help you enhance your language ability. Thank you.
